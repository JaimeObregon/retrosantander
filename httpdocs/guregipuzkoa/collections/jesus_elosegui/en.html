  The Aranzadi Science Society preserves the Jesús Elósegui Irazusta
  Photographic Collection, digitised through an agreement with the Benedictines
  of Lazkao. The process brought together thousands of images on different
  media.
</p>

<p>
  Each photograph was assigned a code and description, using the original
  inventory and contributions from relatives and collaborators. The collection
  is both a tribute to Elósegui, a founder of Aranzadi, and an open resource for
  the public.
