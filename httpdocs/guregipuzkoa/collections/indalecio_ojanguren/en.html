  The photographic collection of Indalecio Ojanguren holds great historical,
  social and anthropological value, the result of his mountain outings and
  travels throughout the Basque Country.
</p>

<p>
  Born in Eibar in 1887, he combined his love for mountaineering with
  photography, working intensively during the first half of the 20th century and
  contributing to various media until his death in 1972.

  The collection was acquired by the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa in the 1960s
  and, after being digitised and catalogued at the General Archive of Gipuzkoa,
  was made available to the public at the Koldo Mitxelena Kulturunea.
