  Like other municipalities in Gipuzkoa, the Oñati Town Council also has its
  space in the Gure Gipuzkoa portal.
</p>

<p>
  The aim is to bring Oñati’s visual heritage closer to residents and visitors
  and to enrich it with new contributions. The collection includes municipal
  photographic archives and works by Jesus Mari Arzuaga and Pedro Luis
  Ormazabal, to whom gratitude is expressed.
