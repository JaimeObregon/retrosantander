  The Donostia-San Sebastián Postcard Collection graphically reflects the
  everyday life of the city at the beginning of the 20th century. As one delves
  deeper into the archive, images appear that go beyond the capital: racing
  driver Rudolf Caracciola in his car, the entry of fascist general Mola into
  Donostia, superb studio portraits of fishermen, boxer Paulino Uzcudun with his
  automobile… endless surprises.

  The collection consists of 5597 images, most of them in black and white. In
  addition to postcards, it also includes photographs, cards, stickers and
  prints.
