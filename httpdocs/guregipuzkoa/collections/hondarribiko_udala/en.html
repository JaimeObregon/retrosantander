  The Hondarribia Town Council has its own space in the Gure Gipuzkoa portal.
</p>

<p>
  The collections include protocol photographs reflecting the institutional life
  of the council over the last 50 years. Another collection, by Luis Mari
  Elosegi Aldasoro, features farmhouses photographed in 1965 and again in the
  1990s, clearly showing their transformation.
