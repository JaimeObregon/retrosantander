<p>The Urnieta Town Council has its own space in the Gure Gipuzkoa portal.</p>

<p>
  The Municipal Archive preserves photographs from the early 20th century,
  including contributions from residents, farmhouse reports and collections of
  landscapes, festivities and cultural activities. In recent decades, contests
  and professional photographers have added new material.
