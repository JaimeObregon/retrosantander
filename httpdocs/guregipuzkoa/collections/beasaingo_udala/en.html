  As many other municipalities in Gipuzkoa have already done, the Beasain Town
  Council also has its own space in the Gure Gipuzkoa portal.
</p>

<p>
  The aim is to bring the town’s visual heritage closer to locals and visitors,
  while inviting everyone to enrich it with their own contributions. In this
  way, the collection grows thanks to users’ input.

<p>
  In short, there is no need to request permission to use the images, provided
  that attribution is given to the Town Council and the author, and any derived
  work is published under the same license.

  If you wish to add information, correct any errors or complete a record, the
  Town Council will review your request and make the appropriate corrections.
