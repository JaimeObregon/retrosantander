<p>
  As many municipalities of Gipuzkoa have already done, Beasain Town Council
  does not want to fall behind and
  <strong
    >this is the space that Beasain Town Council has on the Gure Gipuzkoa
    portal</strong
  >.
</p>

<p>
  With this portal we want to make the visual heritage of our town available to
  the people of Beasain and to visitors. For this reason, we have made available
  the <strong>collection of 5,903 photographs</strong>
  managed by Beasain Town Council. Alongside this goal, we would like to
  encourage users to complete and enrich this collection with their own
  contributions. The aim of this initiative is to complete the collection with
  the contributions made by users on this same website.
</p>

<p>
  In order to allow comfortable and legal access to the photographic contents,
  all the materials we provide to users are published under the Creative Commons
  BY-SA license. The usage licenses of the materials vary depending on their
  origin. Contents managed by the Town Council and whose authorship can be
  attributed are published under a
  <cite>Creative Commons BY-SA</cite> license. On the other hand, contents whose
  authorship could not be established are released under the
  <q>No Known Copyright Restrictions</q>
  designation. If you are the author of any of these photographs, please contact
  us so that we can correct this issue and properly assign authorship and/or
  usage conditions.
</p>

<p>
  Detailed information about the terms of use of Creative Commons licenses is
  available on this website, but their conditions can be summarized as follows:
  <strong
    >to use any of the photographs, it is not necessary to request permission
    from Beasain Town Council, as long as the terms of use are respected:
    attribution to Beasain Town Council and to its author</strong
  >, where applicable, and any derivative work you might create must be released
  under the same CC-BY-SA license.
</p>

<p>
  Finally,

    >if you wish to add additional information, correct an error or complete a
    record</strong
