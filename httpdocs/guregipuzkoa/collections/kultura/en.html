  The Photographic Archive of the Directorate of Cultural Heritage was created
  in 1987-1988 with the Catalogue of Cultural Heritage Buildings of Gipuzkoa, as
  a tool for conservation specialists.
</p>

<p>
  Over time it has been enriched with new materials from visits, restoration
  works and monographic studies on chapels, mills, forges, farmhouses and
  industrial heritage. It is documentary and managerial, not artistic.

  Today it holds tens of thousands of images under a
  <cite>Creative Commons BY-SA</cite> license, compatible with Wikipedia. Users
  must credit the Directorate of Cultural Heritage and, when indicated, the
  photographer, and release derivative works under the same license.
