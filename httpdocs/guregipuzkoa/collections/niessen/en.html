  The Niessen electrotechnical factory was founded in 1914 by Guillermo Niessen.
  For its centenary, documents and photographs illustrating the companyâ€™s
  history were collected.
</p>

<p>
  The images come from company records and former employees, and were digitised
  by the Aranzadi Science Society with the support of ABB.
</p>

<p>
  The collection shows the early years of the factory, its evolution, social
  activities and product catalogues. It is closely linked to Errenteria and
  Oiartzun, where the company has operated and many workers came from.
