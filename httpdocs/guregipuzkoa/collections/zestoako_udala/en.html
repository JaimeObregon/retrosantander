<p>The Zestoa Town Council has its own space in the Gure Gipuzkoa portal.</p>

<p>
  The collections illustrate the town’s history: old postcards linked to the spa
  and early 20th-century tourism; photographs taken in the 1990s by historian
  Vicente Dávila on local heritage; and images by young residents showing the
  former cement factories of the Lower Urola.

<p>
  Permission is not required to use the photographs, provided attribution is
  given to Zestoa Town Council and the author, and any derivative work is
  released under the same license.

  If you wish to add information, correct data or complete records, the Town
  Council will review your request.
