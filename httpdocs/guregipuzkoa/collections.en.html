<h1>Donated collections</h1>

<p>
  Here we present the collections generously donated to Gure Gipuzkoa by public
  and private entities. These images —&#8239;portraits, landscapes,
  celebrations, everyday scenes&#8239;— are now part of a shared heritage
  accessible to all citizens.
</p>

<p>
  The project <strong>remains open to new contributions</strong>. Institutions
  that hold collections of historical, cultural, or emotional value are welcome
  to donate them for inclusion in the portal. The Provincial Council has the
  technical and human resources needed to ensure proper digitization,
  cataloguing, preservation, and dissemination of the materials.
</p>

<p>
  Each new collection helps enrich the shared narrative of our territory and
  identity. <strong>We invite everyone to join in</strong> this collective
  effort to preserve, care for, and give visibility to our photographic
  memory.&nbsp;▣
